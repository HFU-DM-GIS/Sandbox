This is just a sandbox with scripts and code snippets that have been written during the GIS lecture in summer term 2024. Most of the content is simply copied from the [lecture notes](https://uhahne.github.io/GIS/).

### VS Code
The code snippets have been written and demonstrated using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). If you use VS Code, some extensions are recommended to be installed.
